Can you do the api documentation for labels.route.js.

Here is some instruction :
-Use the tag "labels"
-Add responses content and example
-Put the comment block above it's own route
-Optimize the documentation with components (schema, responses, parameters) if necessary

You can base yourself on label's model, service and controller.
